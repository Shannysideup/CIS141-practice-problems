I can't be your love
'Cause I'm afraid I'll ruin your life, hmm
While the leaves withered away
And grew again
You have gone far away
I'll be pushing up daisies
And bring all the chances to here
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life, my seasons
By your side, I'll be your seasons, hmm
My love
